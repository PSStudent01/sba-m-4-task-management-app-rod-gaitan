README.md for Module 411 - SBA Task Management App



This application, called the Task Management App, allows users to add tasks with deadlines, assign categories, and update the status of each task. For the purpose of this project, I customized the app to help me manage the tasks I have been and will be assigned during my Per Scholas training.



The app allows the user to:



select a category (module) from a list of options,



enter a specific task into an input field. An input field was used because each module includes a variety of tasks to complete,



select a deadline using a calendar input,



select a status from a list of three options: “In Progress,” “Completed,” or “Overdue.”



Once all required information has been entered, clicking the “Add Task” button immediately displays the task in the output area and stores the data in local storage for persistence.



Additionally, each displayed task includes a status feature that allows the user to update its status to “In Progress,” “Completed,” or “Overdue,” depending on their progress toward completing the task. However, if the “Overdue” status is automatically applied by the app because the task has passed its deadline, the user cannot manually change that status.



Another feature of this app is the ability to search for and display specific tasks along with their associated metadata, based on the status (“In Progress,” “Completed,” or “Overdue”) selected by the user.
